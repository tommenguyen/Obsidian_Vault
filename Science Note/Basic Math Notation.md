## Liquid
## Liquid Property: Viscosity
![[Pasted image 20240130172135.png]]
- Viscosity is a liquid's resistance to flow and it depends on the particles attraction.
- The stronger the attraction between a liquid's particles, the more ***viscous*** the liquid is.
Example: Peanut butter is an example of a high viscosity liquid
